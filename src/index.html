            <p>The Kitchen Table Mode Tracker (KTM Tracker) is a platform dedicated to creating and managing tournaments for the game Splinterlands. This platform allows players to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Organize tournaments with predefined customizable rule sets, card sets, and level caps as the game provides.</li>
                <li>Join active tournaments and participate in structured competitions.</li>
                <li>Automatically match players into brackets and dynamically update results.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since the KTM Tracker is a third-party platform, all battles must be submitted manually through Splinterlands' Challenge interface. It is the player's responsibility to ensure that challenges are submitted and accepted in accordance with the tournament's predefined rules.</p>
